# Node.js and Express project

## Hi there

## Summary of this project

In this project, I developed a Node.js server using Express framework to handle HTTP requests.
The requests are about creating and reading users information.

API requests are routed with the `/api/users/` address and the `app.get()`, `app.post()`, `app.put()` and `app.delete()` methods, provided by the Express application.
You can create, get, update and delete users (CRUD operations).

Each user has an unique ID, an username and an email. For now, all the users are temporarilly stored, during server running.

## Which technologies are been used

Node.js, Express framework, JavaScript, ESLint (airbnb-base style), Super Linter GitHub action, Linux, Visual Studio Code, VIM (Vi Improved) programmer's text editor.
